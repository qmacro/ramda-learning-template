# ramda-learning-template

A simple template to get myself set up for coding and testing with JavaScript and specifically Ramda. 
Based on a stripped down version of Bob Pace's [ramda-demo](https://github.com/bobpace/ramda-demo) repo, which
accompanies his great [Ramda Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=digajAH_5IU) video, which I recommend you
watch ... at least a couple of times.
